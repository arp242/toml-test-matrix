A test matrix of TOML implementations:
https://arp242.github.io/toml-test-matrix

Rather incomplete at the moment, should add more parsers from
https://github.com/toml-lang/toml/wiki

Adding a parser
---------------
- Add `parser/name`; the naming convention is "[language]-[name].zsh".

- Put commands to build the decoder binary in `setup()`, or add a script in
  `scripts`. It needs to implement the JSON protocol for toml-test, as described
  at https://github.com/toml-lang/toml-test#implementing-a-decoder

- Fill in the `info` array (the `encoder` isn't actually used yet).

Running it
----------
The results are committed in git, so you don't really need to run it unless
you're adding a new parser.

That said, use `./run` to generate the files. You'll need zsh, git, and the
dependencies to build stuff (e.g. compilers/interpreters). It's not super
well-documented: see if you get "command not found" errors and fix them ðŸ™ƒ
